My website is an expansion of DomoMaker. The purpose is for users to be able to keep a personal log of the super 
cute reptiles they find throughout their days. They may give each reptile a name, age, and description. When the 
project is finished the user will also be able to add pictures of the reptiles they find.

The completed version of the website will have space for advertisements in the margins, and an option for the
user to pay to remove the ads.

React is being used to control the Reptiles that are being displayed.

Mongo is being used to store Reptiles and Accounts.

Handlebars is being used to form the framework of the app's pages.

Going forward I will polish the site's asthetics and add the image feature, as well as add specifically marked
areas for advertisements. There will also be a button marked "Remove Ads" in the top right corner of the app.
Once the user clicks that button, all the 'ad spaces' will disappear and the app will look much cleaner and less 
cluttered.
